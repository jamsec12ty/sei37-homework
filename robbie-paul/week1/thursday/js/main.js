// Geometry Function Lab
// Part 1, Rectangle
// Given a rectangle object like the one below, write the following functions:
//
// isSquare(rect) - Returns whether the rectangle is a square or not
// area(rect) - Returns the area of the rectangle
// perimeter(rect) - Returns the perimeter of the rectangle
// const rectangle = {
//   length: 4,
//   width: 4
// };
// In other words, these functions should take as their only argument a single object with the same keys (length, width) as the rectangle object above, and use that object to make the calculations.
//
const rectangle = {
  length: 4,
  width: 4
};

const isSquare = function(rectangle.length, rectangle.width) {
  // ...
}

const area = function(rectangle.length, rectangle.width) {

  let result = rectangle.length * rectangle.width;
  return result;
}

const perimeter = function(rectangle.length, rectangle.width) {


}

function



// Part 2, Triangle
// Given a triangle object like the one below, write the following functions:
//
// isEquilateral(tri) - Returns whether the triangle is equilateral or not



// isIsosceles(tri) - Returns whether the triangle is isosceles or not
// area(tri) - Returns the area of the Triangle
// isObtuse(tri) - Returns whether the triangle is obtuse or not
// const triangle = {
//   sideA: 3,
//   sideB: 4,
//   sideC: 4
// };

// As above, these functions should take a single object as an argument, which will have the same keys as the triangle above, and which you will use for your calcuations.

// The Cash Register
// Write a function called cashRegister that takes a shopping cart object. The object contains item names and prices (itemName: itemPrice). The function should return the total price of the shopping cart. Example
//
// // Input
// const cartForParty = {
//   banana: "1.25",
//   handkerchief: ".99",
//   Tshirt: "25.01",
//   apple: "0.60",
//   nalgene: "10.34",
//   proteinShake: "22.36"
// };
//

const cashRegister = function(cart) {

  let totalPrice = parseInt( Objects.values )

    for in let i = 0; i < objectArray.length; i++) {
      array[i]
    }
  }

// USE- FOR IN LOOP






// // Output
// cashRegister(cartForParty); // 60.55

// JavaScript Bank
// In this homework, you'll create a basic bank in Javascript. The bank has many accounts and the following capabilities that you need to write.
//
// Bank
// There is only one bank. This bank has an array of accounts. The bank needs a method that will return the total sum of money in the accounts. It also needs an addAccount method that will enroll a new account at the bank and add it to the array of accounts. There is no need to create additional functions of the bank to delete accounts, etc.
//
// The bank has many accounts. Accounts should be objects that all share a set of common functionality.
//
// Accounts
// Accounts have a current balance and owner's name. You should be able to deposit or withdraw from an account to change the balance.
//
// There is no need to write a user interface. Make sure functions return values -- you may also have your functions console.log() values to help you see your code working.
//
// You should write a basic story through a series of JavaScript commands that shows that the methods do indeed work as expected: add some accounts, show the total balance, make some deposits and withdrawals, show the new total balance.
//
// Tips
// Don't overthink this. Shorter code is probably the answer.
//
// Bonus
// Ensure that the accounts cannot have negative values.
// Write a 'transfer' on the bank that allows you to transfer amounts between two accounts.
// Additional
// Begin exploring the JavaScript Koans. Fork, clone and start trying them.
