# Nucleotide Count

DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

Each symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.

Write a program that will tell you how many times each nucleotide occurs in a string.

It should also tell you if a character in the string is _not_ a valid nucleotide.

Example:

```ruby
count_nucleotides "AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC"
# output:
A: 20
C: 12
G: 17
T: 21
```
