<h1>Hey Fancy Business Guy</h1>

<p>Look up your favourite stonk here:</p>


<form action="/stocks/lookup">
  <label>
    Stock code:
    <input type="text" name="stock_code">
  </label>

  <button>Lookup</button>

</form>

<br>

<!--
Make a form here with the correct action="" attribute
The form needs a single text input, with a sensible name="" attribute,
which will determine the params[] key in the submit route action
In the submit route, use the stock_quote gem (which is already "required")
to submit the user's stock name to do the lookup
Pull the lastest_price from the result, and save into an instance variable
to show in the submit action's template
