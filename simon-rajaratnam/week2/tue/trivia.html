          <h3>1. Lovelace was buried next to the father she never knew.
          </h4>
          <p>Although Lovelace didn’t know Lord Byron, she maintained a life-long fascination with him and his works. After her death, she was buried at her request in the Byron family vault inside the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in the small English town of Hucknall. Her coffin was placed side-by-side with that of her father, who also passed away at the age of 36.

          <h3>2. At the age of 12, Lovelace conceptualized a flying machine.
          </h3>
          <p>After studying the anatomy of birds and the suitability of various materials, the young girl illustrated plans to construct a winged flying apparatus before moving on to think about powered flight. “I have got a scheme,” she wrote to her mother, “to make a thing in the form of a horse with a steamengine in the inside so contrived as to move an immense pair of wings, fixed on the outside of the horse, in such a manner as to carry it up into the air while a person sits on its back.”

          <h3>3. A computer programming language is named in Lovelace’s honor.
          </h3>
          <p>During the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Defense developed a high-order computer programming language to supersede the hundreds of different ones then in use by the military. When U.S. Navy Commander Jack Cooper suggested naming the new language “Ada” in honor of Lovelace in 1979, the proposal was unanimously approved. Ada is still used around the world today in the operation of real-time systems in the aviation, health care, transportation, financial, infrastructure and space industries.
