HOMEWORK is whichever of the following interests you, but at least the first:
1. add pagination to the Flickr search results, with 'Next Page' and 'Prev Page' buttons/links (BONUS CHALLENGE: pagination via "infinite scroll"; if you do this, use Underscore to make sure the next page isn't loaded more often than every 5 seconds by using a "throttling" function; TURN OFF the Ajax request while you test this and just log something out)
2. add a 'show' page for each thumbnails so that when you click on one, it makes a new API request to show details about a specific photo (larger image, description, link to user account, camera used, etc)
3. add a full-screen slideshow feature which lets you move between large versions of the images without going back to the results (ideally via left/right arrow keys)
4. add location-based search ("show photos within X kilometres of me") using the browser's geolocation features (not as hard as it sounds: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation - you can set a fake location for desktop devices in the Chrome Dev Tools
5. add date-based search ("show photos taken within the last X days")
6. Check the API docs to see how else you can customise your search results! (edited)
